## Universal Queue

DJ rebuilt on Node.js for various reasons.
Universal Queue is a video/music queuing web application which allows users to create and share rooms in which clients add media to. Connected users can search for and add media to the queue as well as vote to skip currently playing media. A host view is also available for connected users to view synced media simultaneously.
